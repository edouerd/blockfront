<p>System Protocol and Economic Incentives for an Ethereum Ecosystem Intelligence Layer</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Blockfront is a decentralized intelligence layer for the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Blockfront investigates the current and future use cases of the ecosystem and network to build visibility and usability infrastructure and tools to facilitate intelligence for developers, traders, investors, users, and other network participants.</p>

<p>The Blockfront protocol addresses Ethereum intelligence along 3 primary areas. 
Network visibility and ecosystem context 
Data accessibility, decentralization, and trust<br />
Query performance and usability</p>

<p>Blockfront’s protocol architecture complements the Ethereum global state machine with a resilient (sub)network of validators, data suppliers, and replicators providing highly available access to actionable metrics and contextual analysis reflecting the Ethereum ecosystem and its onchain transactions, smart contracts, and token projects as well as its nodes and network.</p>

<p>In doing so, Blockfront creates a foundation for nearchain and onchain API gateways and oracles to power network-driven smart contracts, crypto-products, and dApps towards the promise of the distributed global supercomputer.</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>The rise of the API and interoperable service architecture is what allowed the cambrian explosion of innovation and value creation in the Web 2.0 era. Infrastructure-as-a-Service as provided by Amazon, Google, DigitalOcean, DNS services and others made starting a web business exponentially easier.</p>

<p>Yet today blockchains focus on providing just one part of that stack: canonical trustless data and exchange. For blockchain ecosystems like Bitcoin and Ethereum to mature, they require additional utilities and non-native infrastructure. Web3 era businesses, services, and protocols will be built on a new set of tools and infrastructure that are as trustless and decentralized as they are ??.</p>

<p>In particular, the wide ambitions and rapid growth of the Ethereum ecosystem presents challenges that must be addressed outside the scope of the underlying blockchain technology itself. In this section, we give an overview of blockchains, general purpose trustless computing, the rise of ecosystem projects, and describe how Blockfront aims to accelerate interoperability and project tooling with an ecosystem intelligence layer for the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>Blockfront complements Ethereum’s resilient global computing network by providing:
Trustless intelligence and data
A performant blockchain query gateway
Network visibility and monitoring
(For the next generation of decentralized organizations, smart contracts, and applications to be built on top of.)</p>

<p>« scalability as a problem of trust / scalability as a problem of visibility / scalability as a problem of query usability »</p>

<p>Case Study: The Bitcoin Ecosystem</p>

<p>In 2008, Nakamoto published the bitcoin whitepaper and the first version of the working client, initiating a flurry of public and private discussion and development activity around the first trustless digital money system.</p>

<p>In its simplest functional form, a blockchain is a cryptographically-linked chain of time-stamped events with distributed copies across a network of peers. 
https://oleganza.com/all/what-is-blockchain/</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s blockchain design was historically significant in functionally merging together a number of existing proven concepts, technologies, and projects into a new resilient system.</p>

<p>These technologies preceding Bitcoin’s innovation include public key cryptography, cryptographic signatures, cryptographic hash functions, cryptographic timestamps, SHA-256 encryption, Byzantine fault tolerance, P2P networks, and related projects B-money, Hashcash, and Bit Gold.
https://www.gwern.net/Bitcoin-is-Worse-is-Better</p>

<p>Where Bitcoin was novel was in its ability to help remove trust and centralization in the consensus process. In manifesting the first blockchain for bitcoin, Nakamoto used this cryptographically-linked chain to create a global ledger and network, facilitating a community of technology and business development utilizing, tinkering, and furthering trustless cryptographic currency consensus systems.</p>

<p>Since Bitcoin emerged in 2008, Bitcoin as a technology, network, and ecosystem have undergone several phases, the most recent centering on a  community divided over scalability approaches. Similarly, much of the development efforts address Layer 2 scaling initiatives.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Outside of bitcoin, several generations of new blockchain projects have emerged interacting, improving, and/or forking different facets of blockchain and cryptographic systems.</p>

<p>In a 10 year timespan from 2008 to 2018, went from a test software, theory, and play money to thousands of cryptocurrency/blockchain projects and companies, a boom in academic interest and publication, and half trillion dollar market cap.</p>

<p>Like bitcoin itself, each new project is an experimental system negotiating the tradeoffs and design decisions of new forms of cryptographic protocols and their “scalability trilemma” - decentralization, scalability, and safety attributes.

<p>The Ethereum Ecosystem</p>

<p>In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum white paper, outlining the concept for a general computing platform expressed as a new independent blockchain protocol supporting a Turing complete programming language. Expanding from Bitcoin’s limited scripting capabilities, Ethereum would utilize blockchain technology to coordinate decentralized consensus around general, arbitrary computing – smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and eventually decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper</p>

<p>Ethereum can be thought of as a replicated data structure which maintains cryptographic proof of global state for a distributed Turing complete computer. However, as with Bitcoin, Ethereum as a working technology belies Ethereum as an interactive ecosystem and as a network of value and computation.</p>

<p>As the first blockchain platform allowing arbitrary computing, Ethereum has garnered the vast majority of mindshare within the blockchain development community as well as among investors and dApp users. Initial Coin Offering funding events for hundreds of projects has culminated in ~$8B USD of funding. With much of that funding occuring on the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum has found itself as a primary platform for emerging projects.</p>

<p>https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/</p>

<p>https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/08/how-ethereum-became-the-platform-of-choice-for-icod-digital-assets/</p>

<p>Ethereum’s unique computational capability and its entrenched position as the leading blockchain development platform make it make it a primary candidate to become the foundation of the Web3 stack. However, both the rapid growth of the ecosystem and Ethereum’s wide platform goals present present significantly challenging requirements for scalability and general usage.</p>

<p>The expectation of the Web 3 future is such that Ethereum users, including any number of hardware devices, should be able to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem without running a node.</p>

<p>Nodes:
A multitude of users and devices are expected to be able to securely interact with the Ethereum ecosystem without running a full node.</p>

  <p>Trust (it’s about nodes)

<blockquote>

<p>As a younger technology, its client software is under active development to account for a subset of these challenges.</p>

<p>Scalability and Trust</p>

<p>Just as the cryptocurrency marketcap has exponentially grown, the network usage has as well. This sentiment is captured in a well-referenced network metric, the Network Value Transaction ratio (NVT Ratio).

<p>«insert updated graphs with different node sync types»</p>

<p>The ever-growing size of Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s blockchains are reflective of the Nakamoto consensus design, in which miners compete in computation resources to create the next valid block for the chain with the most cumulative proof of work, which is used to determine consensus at any given time and “thermo-dynamically secure” the ledger.
https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09964.html</p>

<p>Of course, as blockchain networks grow, operating full nodes become computationally more expensive. At the time of this writing, the size of the blockchains for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 159 GB and 350 GB respectively. 
https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size

<p>Bitcoin’s Approach to Network Scalability</p>

<p>In order to scale, Nakomoto envisioned that most users would eventually not be running full nodes. 
“The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.“ (Satoshi, 2010) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306</p>

<p>Research in 2014 by Lopp concludes that operating a node was not a bottleneck for the Bitcoin network. In 2014, SPV nodes constituted a small fraction of the network, and data propagation was relatively fast achieving transactions to 50% of the network within 2 seconds. Blocks propagating within 5 seconds.<br />
https://medium.com/@lopp/the-state-of-the-bitcoin-network-2b6911fd9e32</p>

<p>21.co runs a Bitcoin node crawler service. At this time 11450 nodes have open ports.</p>

<p>https://bitnodes.earn.com/dashboard/?days=730</p>

<p>https://coin.dance/nodes</p>

<p>Although Lukedashjr, mentions that here could be many more. 
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clearing_Up_Misconceptions_About_Full_Nodes</p>

<p>152,000 non-listening nodes. 
http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html</p>

<p>Bitcoin clients that do not run a full node can also opt to run a light client utilizing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). Rather than syncing with the full chain, SPV clients syncs with block headers (80 bytes each block) and use bloom filters (BIP 37) to efficiently find transactions of interest and retrieve the Merkle root to prove inclusion.
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki</p>

<p>While SPV nodes typically connect to four or more nodes, other nodes can still selectively pass on (and omit) blocks to SPV nodes, potentially subjecting SPV nodes to Sybil attacks. For example, 1) omitting a valid block and propagating an invalid block (with a valid proof of work) but invalid transaction or 2) simply withholding information on a relevant transaction to an address.</p>

<p>In July 2015, such a chain fork occurred as a miner was not validating blocks with the recent BIP66 rules. Although quickly addressed by the community, this led SPV wallets in particular to be vulnerable over a short period of time. 
https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining</p>

<p>Furthermore, SPV is known to leak wallet addresses and therefore is not suitable for users interested in conserving privacy.
https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/763.pdf</p>

<p>That being said, SPV are still vastly convenient for the light client user, but in order to support such nodes, full nodes must filter and process the full blockchain to service the light client’s request. This burden on the full node’s disk I/O, bandwidth, and computing on behalf of the light client is a scalability concern. 
https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/</p>

<p>Even further, Todd demonstrates the scalability issue’s underlying resource mismatch can be used to initiate denial-of-service attacks.
https://github.com/petertodd/bloom-io-attack
https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-security-model-deep-dive/</p>

<p>While an SVP node is sufficient for many users, due to the scalability and security issues listed above, Bitcoin best practice is to run a full node to transact. As Peter Todd says: “The only full node that matters is yours.”</p>

<p>Ethereum Nodes</p>

<p>As noted previously, Ethereum’s ambitious scope demands alternative scalability approaches. Its primary difference from the Bitcoin network is the need of full nodes to support a much larger state and state history to accompany the transaction ledger.</p>

<p>A full “naive” Ethereum node is referred to as an Archival nodes and is typically used for historical state, blockchain explorers, stats, etc.
https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill/status/875907274308321280
« more on what archive nodes are needed for , insert content from our blog post »</p>

<p>An archival node has a significant disk I/O requirement as every smart contract is being performed and replayed, each updating the disk state. Only solid state drives can be used as standard mechanical hard drives do not support the amount of IO operations per second (IOPS) required to sync with the Ethereum state. Ethereum infrastructure and enterprise services are reporting the recent increased popularity to struggle to keep up with - especially on virtualized servers where IOPS can be expensive.
https://medium.com/@lopp/the-challenges-of-building-ethereum-infrastructure-87e443e47a4b</p>

<p>« insert some of our data here»</p>

<p>Because of these fundamental challenges, performance is a primary goal for Ethereum client development teams.</p>

<p>Ethereum Alternate Node Sync</p>

<p>Parity and Geth are currently the two main client implementations of Ethereum respectively have defaulted to –warp and fast as the standard “quick” synchronization mode.</p>

<p>Quick synchronization allows the blockchain to be downloaded but computation of each block to not be processed. https://wiki.parity.io/Getting-Synced
Database pruning, also called state-tree  or state trie pruning, reduces the amount of state to a certain number of recent blocks, making the assumption that state will not be reverted.
https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/26/state-tree-pruning/
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/174/what-is-state-trie-pruning-and-how-does-it-work</p>

<p>Geth fast enables quick sync and database pruning. Geth full is similar to the Archival node discussed above. Parity currently has two sync configurations, warp/no warp and fast/archive. Comparable to Geth full, Parity’s archive node is no-warp archive. Comparable to Geth fast is Parity warp fast, quick sync and database pruning. Where different is that Parity also has a no-warp fast mode, slow sync but with pruning making it “ possible to run a full-verifying Ethereum node with a small database.”
https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a</p>

<p>«pros / cons and use cases of each node type from blog post »</p>

<p>Ethereum Light Client</p>

<p>Ethereum’s version of Simplified Payment Verification is the light client protocol which is under development and active research. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol
Parity and Geth both have experimental light client implementations and new proposals are in progress. https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Light-Client</p>

<p>“We imagine that, given the monotonically growing storage requirements for maintaining a full node, most nodes will prune both historical blocks and block-states in the near future. A heavily-pruned network should not detract from the viability or usability of a light node.
Our proposal is to integrate this with the CHTs, such that full nodes may discard the majority of ranges of blocks, but perhaps maintain the CHT for the ranges which they discard. Full nodes will also be required to maintain specific ranges of blocks and receipts (every nth range of 2048, for example) based on something similar to a Kademlia Node Identifier – a node’s failure to provide blocks it is expected to hold will be considered misbehavior.</p>

<p>https://wiki.parity.io/The-Parity-Light-Protocol-(PIP).html</p>

<p>A recent version of Geth’ light client (1.7.3) was unstable due to recent development on log filtering for smart contracts. The latest geth version is expected to re-stabilize the light client. 
https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/02/14/geth-1-8-iceberg¹/</p>

<p>However, with Bitcoin as a model and Ethereum’s additional throughput and computation, one can foresee issues supporting a light client with Ethereum.</p>

<p>// end of context/background section</p>

<p>In the previous sections, we discussed bitcoin’s innovation in the consensus system, Ethereum’s development and relation to the Bitcoin blockchain, and examined some of the client and scalability infrastructure issues that Bitcoin and Ethereum have and are experiencing.</p>

<p>Ethereum as a younger technology with a much wider use case needs to learn from Bitcoin’s scalability initiatives as well as expand its effort. Blockfront addresses this through an intelligence context layer that also provides scalability for the growing developer ecosystem.</p>

<p>Ethereum Use Case
By nature of Ethereum’s support of arbitrary computing, Ethereum must also support a broad-range of use cases. The expectation of the Web 3 future is such that Ethereum users should be able to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem without running a node. They may be interacting with dApps and accessing the services themselves through Metamask and a hosted node service. Or using a hosted wallet service such as MyEtherWallet.</p>

<p>Monahan makes this argument well in “The Future of Ethereum Doesn’t Have Wallets”. 
https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-future-of-ethereum-doesnt-have-wallets-232fcee708bf#52c1
“The winning solution in the long term will likely be something even more invisible and more seamless [than a web3 browser or browser extension].”</p>

<p>While it’s possible to use one’s own node, in practice, with light node implementations in experimental and research stage, today’s, and likely the future’s, users would typically be using infrastructural services in order to forego the operation of an Ethereum node and ensure more stability.</p>

<p>Intelligence Infrastructure for Ethereum</p>

<p>When envisioning the promise of Ethereum as a world computer, scalability is often cited as a chief concern.</p>

<p>Blockfront helps to address ecosystem scalability by facilitating an ultra light interface for the Web 3 stack and Ethereum network. Through Blockfront’s protocol, decentralized, on-demand access to trusted visibility data will create usability and capacity for dapp and smart contract development without managing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Blockfront complements a number of initiatives from light clients, proof of stake, infrastructure as a service, to analytics - to build a resilient distributed intelligence layer of the Web 3 and Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

<p>Specialist Services</p>

<p>Due to the requirements for running a node as discussed in previous sections, a rich ecosystem of blockchain services have cropped up from hosted on-line wallets and exchanges to analytics providers.</p>

<p>One fundamental design question which has stayed with Bitcoin since the early days is around scalability of the network as compared to traditional payment processors.</p>

<p>In 2013 as the debate around centralization of nodes in the Bitcoin network, node infrastructure started to garner more attention as an area of work.</p>

<p>With the expectation that most network participants would not be running a node, and the 
cost of running a node rising to non-trivial levels, specialist on-demand services inevitably came be part of the ecosystem</p>

<p>These services come in several forms. 
DIY running nodes on cloud infrastructure became more and more prevalent -

<p>Since then the cost of running a full node virtually has gone up from $10/mo to now $40/mo. Full node, one of the hosted services has since gone out of business, citing profitability amidst rising costs as a concern.
https://bravenewcoin.com/news/the-decline-in-bitcoins-full-nodes/</p>

<p>Ethereum Infrastructure</p>

<p>In the Ethereum network, the demand spurred by was much more apparent due to the demands of the developer ecosystem. In 2016, only 1 year after Ethereum’s initial release, Infura launched at Devcon 2, providing virtual Ethereum nodes, infrastructure as a service. Inspired by the needs of Consensys, an Ethereum development/venture studio.</p>

<p>Hermansson of Consensys writes, “Delivering infrastructure at this scale comes at a real price though. If you have tried to run a full Ethereum node, you know that gone are the days where it is possible to run on a laptop or on a simple cloud virtual machine.”</p>

<p>Using benchmarking methodology,
 I/O heavy or cPU heavy 
Analyzes using m5.xlarge vs i3.xlarge 
Variablity in RPC calls also translates to variability in latency.</p>

<p>Hermansson’s analysis suggests that with Ethereum’s network demand growing rapidly. Infrastructure needs have to be carefully considered with real tradeoffs between performance and cost.</p>

<p>https://blog.infura.io/optimizing-performance-and-cost-infura-benchmark-analysis-f083ccf8f6ac</p>

<p>Transaction Throughput
While it’s expected that the client development teams will improve performance significantly, Ethereum’s network has grown exponentially with many more projects coming on-line as per investment in the space.</p>

<p>Looking at the Ethereum blockchain, we can see a range in 2018 from  700,000-1,250,000 transactions per day or 8-15 transactions per second.</p>

<p>https://etherscan.io/chart/tx</p>

<p>With no additional scalability improvements, miner’s can theoretically increase their own block gas limit; although there is a trade off as bigger blocks take longer to propagate and thus increase the likelihood of staleness.</p>

<p>In the Ethereum protocol, uncles are a way to formally reinclude stale but recent blocks into the chain. Comparing the uncle count to the blockcount, one can calculate an uncle rate is also a proxy for staleness of blocks. At the time of writing, one sees uncle rates often exceeding 20%.<br />
https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles
https://etherscan.io/chart/blocks
 https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/31/uncle-rate-transaction-fee-analysis/</p>

<p>The gas limit is thus able to be increased to include more transactions, but there is an equilibrium that is managed as uncle blocks have lower rewards than regular blocks and will lower the miner’s overall base reward, and uncle blocks are currently relatively high.</p>

<p>Outside of the gas limit, there are also limitations for network bandwidth, computation, and efficiency of propagation via clients.</p>

<p>An older bitcoin propagation study shows a block propagation time of 2 seconds + data transmission http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~ler/docencia/rcs1314/papers/P2P2013_041.pdf</p>

<p>«Ethstats, a collection of self-reported data, block propagation time»</p>

<p>Many scalability projects are directly aimed at increasing the possible throughput of ethereum through sharding, state channels, side chains, and more.</p>

<p>«research on query performance of ethereum RPC»</p>

<p>«amount of connections a node can have»
Bitcoin 8, ethereum 13 connections</p>

<p>Queries
Harder to capture than transactions, but perhaps as important, are the queries to which the network responds. As a peer-to-peer network, one doesn’t know which queries are made to which nodes, only what queries one receives.</p>

<p>Henry He writes,” Today it seems nobody has a good estimate on the total volume of Ethereum queries and hence it makes it harder to figure out what’s really going on with the network.”
https://hackernoon.com/11000-1-ethereum-query-to-transaction-ratio-whats-going-on-fb12382fd0c6</p>

<p>As a market leader in providing node infrastructure, Infura appears to process a significant amount of Ethereum transactions and queries to the reported tune of 6 billion queries per day growing from 20 million queries per day in 2017.
https://blog.infura.io/infura-debuts-new-visual-identity-as-daily-requests-top-6-billion-644c6e8f389a</p>

<p>For an apples-to-orange comparison, He cites Google’s 3.5 billion search queries per day, suggesting that 6 billion queries is an outsized amount.</p>

<p>Assuming Infura provides 70% of all Eth queries and 10-20% of Eth transactions, He finds that the query to transaction ratio on Ethereum would be 14,000 queries to 1 transaction.</p>

<p>He then later makes the case for greater inquiry into the high query volume, bringing to bear many questions around Ethereum’s design, common dapp architecture, the nature of the query volume, and more that the network lacks visibility into.</p>

<p>As the next generation of dapps become mainstream introducing new load to the network, both query and transaction scalability are both areas to consider.</p>

<p>Scalability</p>

<p>Blockchains are often contrasted with traditional 3rd party payment processors, capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, but based on current metrics, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to operate at orders-of-magnitude lower scale while grappling with difficult implementation questions.</p>

<p>Many of the scalability solutions today address both transaction and query performance by offloading the network by sharding (splitting the network) and other offchain/nearchain solutions.</p>

<p>Ethereum is however stuck in a dilemma reminiscent of Jevon’s Paradox.

As the network becomes more reliable, more dapps launch, as more dapps launch more users are attracted. If the promise of web 3 is delivered, one can expect demand to grow exponentially.</p>

<p>By directly addressing how the network can create a highly scalable, trusted intelligence layer, Blockfront addresses scalability as a complement to existing initiatives focusing on enabling the internet of money to permissionlessly transmit trusted data at-scale.</p>

<p>As blockchain themselves have reiterated, in the information age, knowledge is power. Thus, accessibility facilitates power.</p>

<p>Serverless Computing</p>

<p>The modern software development draws many lessons for the management of data, computation, and scale that are helpful in informing blockchains.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, infrastructure and the devops movement has gone through a renaissance. Sophisticated tooling and scaffolding reduced inputs such that applications could be low-cost yet also retain advantages of scale and distribution.</p>

<p>With cloud computing, containerization, serverless and other new patterns, a startup no longer has to maintain their own servers and data centers.</p>

<p>Many of today’s Ethereum-based Web 3 applications use a serverless architecture.</p>

<p>Function as a service</p>

<p>Blockchains have done something similar with consensus. 
No longer would I have to gain the trust through extended 
Permissionless, programmatic, open source internet money is</p>

<p>In fact, programming for Web 3 draws many similarities</p>

<p>Trusting Nodes</p>

<p>While node infrastructure providers like Infura offer a much-needed service, following .</p>

<p>There are drawbacks to providing a centralized, hosted server. Namely, trust.</p>

<p>In fact, nodes are not able to trustlessly pass information to other nodes. Each node must validate and invalidate blocks themselves. A node is not able to warn another node of an invalid block. Similarly, a SPV node is not able to warn others that a full node is censoring their transactions.

<p>Proof of stake and sharding initiatives aim to help with determining finality in consensus (not probabilistically). Several research projects on Proof of Stake are in progress (and many more delegated proof of stake). However, there is some counterpoint as to whether Proof of Stake actually will deliver over current solutions. Perhaps most convincingly, Proof of Work is and has worked for the past 10 years. http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/</p>

<p>P2P Attacks
Besides 51% and other proof-of-work attacks which required mining, proof-of-work consensus systems, like other peer-to-peer networks, are potentially subject to other attack types.</p>

<p>Several deleterious scenarios are possible:
Withholding or censoring network activity (transactions)
Altering of network activity
Delays of network activity (DDOS)
homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~ghosh/P2P_Attacks.ppt</p>

<p>Two attacks which cause such types of disruptions in P2P networks are Sybil and Eclipse attacks.</p>

<p>Sybil Attack
Sybil Attacks are when a malicious agent simulates multiple identities to flood the network to undermine network trust.</p>

<p>Eclipse Attacks
An eclipse attack occurs when a malicious agent gains control over a node’s flow of data by making it such that the node is only communicating with the agent’s malicious nodes and not connecting to the greater network. 
https://medium.com/mit-security-seminar/eclipse-attacks-on-bitcoin-s-peer-to-peer-network-e0da797302c2</p>

<p>In March 2018, researchers published a paper disclosing details of a reported vulnerability. 
Pre-Geth 1.8.1, Geth clients were able to generate nodes on-demand with different public keys from the same machine and IP address, allowing node spoofing. Ethereum also uses a structured network protocol, Kademlia, to facilitate connections between node peers rather than Bitcoin’s unstructured protocol, which facilitates connection with randomization. The combination allowed unlimited Ethereum nodes to be created by an agent, and the Kademlia protocol to be manipulated such that eclipse attacks were possible. As part of the bounty disclosure, the researchers worked with the Ethereum foundation, and these vulnerabilities were patched in Geth 1.8.1.

<p>Despite that, one has reason to suspect that blockchain networks are not immune to Sybil and Eclipse attacks. Node emulation remains theoretically feasible.

<p>Mitigations</p>

<p>Blockfront’s trusted data protocol is designed considering these vulnerabilities which impede censorship resistance of the web 3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>For sufficiently high value transactions, one should expand their threat model to these considerations, and therefore a centralized hosted node service can leave one open to considerable risk.</p>

<p>Public API</p>

<p>Infura and public API services do exist, but as explored previously, query volume appears to be growing exponentially, and nodes one does not run themselves leave several vulnerability vectors.</p>

<p>Blockfont provides 1) a way to create a market around supply and demand 2) a mechanism for trustless verification which we believe is necessary for professional-grade applications to emerge.</p>

<p>Sending a transaction via Metamask and verifying on Etherscan may be sufficient for many day-to-day users, but for enterprise services moving hundreds of thousands if not millions or billions of dollars worth of ether a day, a more robust solution will contribute to less vulnerable and more viable businesses and ultimately a stronger ecosystem.</p>

<p>Blockfront</p>

<p>Blockchains provide economic incentives for sharing and agreeing on data (transactions) into a global ledger. In networking to propagate these transactions and achieve consensus, node and miner interactions can be observed which are not canonized on chain. 
Blockfront provides verified visibility into the on-chain transactions, network telemetry data, and allows the data to be performantly queried. 
Allowing for efficient, scalable dapp development.</p>

<p>If blockchains are fundamentally new types of networks that will build
Then scaffolding is necessary to help trustlessly bootstrap these networks.
As can be seen by today’s enterprise services in both bitcoin and ethereum, significant technology infrastructure is created in order to deliver their core value proposition.</p>

<p>Blockfront’s network aims to remove the need for enterprises to roll their own blockchain data infrastructure to focus on their unique and competitive offering. Blockfront therefore desires to facilitate the growth of the web 3 and blockchain ecosystems just as the cloud and infrastructure movements did for modern technology and startup industries.</p>

<p>Blockfront’s network</p>

<p>The Blockfront network consists of a coalition of Verifiers, Data Providers, and Replicators.</p>

<p>Concept
Description
Data Node
A Blockfront node storing and transmitting on-chain and near-chain data to the network from its underlying Ethereum Parity node.
Replicator Node
A Blockfront node participating in the transmission of requested data, but not necessarily running a full Ethereum Parity node.
Verifier Node
// not sure how verification mechanism works yet
Requester
Blockfront node making API requests for data via the Blockfront block explorer dApp or their own app gateway.
FRONT Token
Protocol token for the Blockfront network</p>

<p>Reference Dapp
Blockfront’s reference dApps, the API gateway and block explorer, will query the Blockfront network for a baseline amount of data. Providing an early demand for network validators.</p>

<p>Data responses are signed by each node to easily validate originated data.</p>

<p>Blockfront API Gateway
As per the philosophy of building an “ultra light client”, Blockfront intends to abstract the need for 
Servicing both power users and casual consumers that may only have cursory understanding of blockchains but still want to participate in the decentralized web3 future</p>

<p>When comparing current public APIs to the node JSON-RPC, RESTful APIs make significant stylistic design changes to facilitate dApp development.</p>

<p>“The RESTful APIs provide an interface that’s very similar to the JSON-RPC API, but the non-state-changing methods (“reads”) are made available as HTTP GETs instead of POSTs, which is more natural and intuitive for Web development. A handful of state-changing methods (“writes”) such as eth_sendRawTransaction remain as POSTs and are identical to the JSON-RPC version.”
https://blog.infura.io/infrastructure-means-apis-introducing-the-infura-api-49f2951bb6ba</p>

<p>Blockfront’s API can be separated into several sections.
Chain API
Telemetry API
Context API</p>

<p>Blockfront’s Chain API is an analog to the node JSON-RPC. Directly querying on-chain.</p>

<p>Blockfront’s Telemetry API provides the network metrics that do not get captured on-chain.</p>

<p>Finally, Blockfront’s Context API provides second order data analysis, arbitrary querying. For instance, one can crawl the blockchain to find all instances of a particular security vulnerability or trigger notifications for particular activity on a specific token project.</p>

<p>Sample API Spec</p>

<p>bandwidth - for metrics related to the node’s bandwidth usage
blocks - metrics related to properties of an individual block
message - metrics related to p2p messages processed by the node
misbehavior - metrics related to the node flagging suspicious behavior
peers - aggregate properties of the peers to which the node is connected
transactions - aggregate properties of transactions the node processed
utxoset - properties of the current UTXO set, triggered by RPC
Tokens / second
Unused gas 
Out-of-gas exception
Invalid transaction
insufficient gas, invalid instructions, insufficient stack items, stack items would overflow above 1024, invalid JUMP/JUMPI destination, etc.
Contract creation
Account creation / discarded
“One of the important indicators of how much load the Ethereum blockchain can safely handle is how the uncle rate responds to the gas usage of a transaction.”

<p>Data Nodes
As the web 3 ecosystem matures, we expect more and more data will be requested via the API as web developers desire the ability to query without significant knowledge acquisition of how blockchain tooling work.</p>

<p>Advanced blockchain developers may seek to request data from data nodes themselves. Data nodes run an indexing database which can be arbitrarily queried. Currently, Mongodb is used as in indexing, so advanced query are supported.</p>

<p>Developers may still want to use the wildcard API endpoint to execute queries as the API will coordinate randomization of sample nodes.</p>

<p>Query Complexity
The Ethereum protocol uses gas to represent the computational complexity for a given smart contract. Gas is denominated in Gwei (0.000000001 ETH). Each OPCODE in the Ethereum Virtual Machine has been assigned a fixed gas cost. With a minimum basi transaction cost of 21,000 gas. The gas cost is one mechanism to prevent network abuse and efficient allocation of network resources.
Appendix G of the Ethereum yellow paper
https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf</p>

<p>Blockfront’s API and protocol will similarly measure query complexity to accurately price data measurement and delivery.</p>

<p>This assists in solving a significant painpoint in today’s infrastructure which may become a scaling issue; Not all API calls are created equal. 
“ For example, eth_blockNumber is pretty lightweight and due to its nature, provides an opportunity to cache given it only changes about every 15.. I mean, 21 seconds (see Ethereum Ice Age).
Now let’s consider eth_getLogs and it’s impact on an Ethereum client. The “getLogs” method has become a very common tool for the Dapp developer to query previous blocks and transactions for data needed to determine current actions. While it has shown to be extremely useful to Dapp developers, the getLogs method is extremely heavy on an Ethereum client and its underlying chaindata database structure.
Imagine a call to search for any arbitrary array of data from block zero to the current block (currently ~4.1 million blocks). In this case, a call to eth_getLogs would initiate a sequential scan of the entire database, bringing that particular node to a crawl for several minutes. It isn’t that difficult to initiate a Denial-of-service attack against an Ethereum node using this technique.”
https://blog.infura.io/not-all-api-calls-are-equal-3659c119bb6c</p>

<p>Luckily due to the nature of Blockfront’s database design, getLogs itself will not necessarily be as expensive of an operation.</p>

<p>The initial fee schedule and complexity measurement will be made in conjunction with final database architecture. We expect this to be an important area of research.</p>

<p>Lower costs will allow for greater throughput will have real gains by lowering the barrier to entry for dapp development or data analysis.</p>

<p>As blockfront nodes index all state, costs will be clear and transparent. And we expect as more nodes to come on-line for query costs set by the protocol to be guidelines which can fluctuate based on supply and demand. The cost to consumer will be an accurate reflection of the query’s costs to the Blockfront network.</p>

<p>Previous identical queries that are cached by the blockfront dApp are cheaper to reproduce. And the original requester will be paid a fraction of the subsequent requests as an origination fee. Archived data will live in a data marketplace which is investigated in a later section.</p>

<p>Blockfront Ecosystem
While the Blockfront decentralized block explorer and API gateways are powerful tools in and of themselves, we expect a micro Ethereum tool and app ecosystem to emerge from the Blockfront protocol.</p>

<p>Oracles
At the forefront, we expect oracles to be a 
Using Blockfront’s verified data, we create the foundation for an oracle platform using the Ethereum blockchain to bootstrap trust.</p>

<p>Blockfront’s protocol meets the definition of several types of oracles.

<p>Blockfront Protocol</p>

<p>Informed by existing solutions and ecosystem challenges, the Blockfront protocol utilizes a network of role-based nodes to verify, index, and transport data from the Ethereum blockchain and network. Blockfront’s protocol is designed to ensure trusted throughput and performant scalability to power Web 3 development, complementing the existing Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

<p>Finality</p>

<p>Blockfront nodes</p>

<p>Blockfront nodes have a number of roles and jobs. Each Blockfront node runs the Blockfront client which lives on top of the Ethereum client.</p>

<p>As public Ethereum nodes can also be queried, Blockfront nodes will provide a portion of bandwidth to the public network.</p>

<p>Blockfront nodes’s minimum requirements, thus, must take into consideration participation in both the Ethereum network and Blockfront network.</p>

<p>Blockfront nodes are expected to comply with a number of performance requirements to be successful participants in the network.
Bandwidth
Compute
Uptime
Diskspace</p>

<p>Blockfront protocol incentivizes these characteristics through a staking mechanism, rewarding nodes that meet performance requirements as sampled by the protocol and slashing stake for nodes that are not performing as expected.</p>

<p>Node Types</p>

<p>Blockfront nodes come in a number of forms to provide a robust separation of roles within the network.</p>

<p>These nodes include
Requestor
Replicator (Connector)
Insight (Supplier)
Validators</p>

<p>A requestor will make a request to match.</p>

<p>dApps may include on-demand analytics providers, notification services, and other protocols which require reliable, trusted services.</p>

<p>Insight Nodes</p>

<p>Insight nodes are data suppliers which form the basis of a network. They respond to requests for data via the matching state channel. A standard set of metrics is captured and stored in the Insight node’s database with an associated verification proof.</p>

<p>Verification Nodes</p>

<p>Verification nodes are validators. Insight nodes can also act as verifiers, but verification nodes themselves in only validating have lower storage requirements.</p>

<p>Verification nodes check data that is sent, compares it against their own, and signs.</p>

<p>Replicator Nodes</p>

<p>In order to quickly on-board Blockfront nodes to the network, a connector database is used to propagate. As with verification, Insight nodes can also serve as replicator nodes given enough bandwidth.</p>

<p>Data Discrepancy</p>

<p>All Blockfront nodes run a full Ethereum node - in order to validate results.</p>

<p>As finality can not be ensured in Ethereum and other proof-of-work based consensus system, discrepancies are inevitable, and one can only think of states probabilistically.</p>

<p>Given a discrepancy, more nodes will be queried to produce a larger reference set.</p>

<p>Matching</p>

<p>As Blockfront is aiming to have exponentially better performance than querying public nodes, near but offchain solutions are necessary. Blockfront will explore a variety of matching options with state channels being a focus for immediate development.</p>

<p>For additional privacy, Keep’s secure multiparty computation protocol can be used to generate secrets.</p>

<p>FRONT Token</p>

<p>FRONT Token is the protocol token of the Blockfront network. Each FRONT token is divisible by 10^18.</p>

<p>Token economics</p>

<p>Blockfront token rewards are used to incentivize honest node behavior and match validator supply and demand.</p>

<p>Portion of fees are staked.</p>

<p>Inflation needs to match pace of Blockfront’s overall economic growth.</p>

<p>Decentralized Storage</p>

<p>Decentralized storage providers have emerged as one of the first web 3 layers. 
Blockfront will utilize these protocols to naively warehouse data.</p>

<p>Sia
Filecoin
Storj
Swarm</p>

<p>Initially, a number of decentralized storage providers will be used for data warehousing to determine usability and performance. As the market matures, decentralized storage providers at-scale will need to grow to deal with throughput and bandwidth issues which currently  affect reliability.</p>

<p>Through testing and partnerships, Blockfront will identify long-term solution partners which will best suit the use cases of the Blockfront network and its participants.</p>

<p>Data Marketplace</p>

<p>The Blockfront protocol acts as an on-demand API with naive data warehousing and aggregation using decentralized storage providers.</p>

<p>This data gets aggregated 
We are investigating ways to distribute these data sets in a meaningful way</p>

<p>In addition to decentralized storage, Blockfront will investigate emerging Data Marketplaces.
Ocean Protocol is one such project aiming to provide a protocol for trading arbitrary data. As AI and blockchains interact, Ocean Protocol believes that there needs to be an accessible data marketplace to connect data sets with AI/ML researchers and developers</p>

<p>Network Distribution</p>

<p>While it has been shown that Ethereum’s use of the Kademlia peer-to-peer protocol makes it vulnerable to eclipse attacks, Blockfront can use the known properties of the Kadmelia networking protocol’s structure to facilitate an optimal Blockfront p2p network graph on top of a node’s Ethereum network graph.</p>

<p>As Blockfront is intended to have optimal coverage of the Ethereum network, any work in Blockfront’s networking protocol must reflect new developments into Ethereum client’s peer discovery protocols.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_distribution</p>

<p>Due to our strict node requirements, our sub-network of Ethereum can have adequate connections with the greater Ethereum node network and miners to be confident we are receiving a representative, supermajority of data.</p>

<p>In addition, for our verification protocol to operate successfully, the Blockfront network’s need 
verification redundancy but also</p>

<p>Using Blockfront’s telemetry API, Blockfront can be used to sample data of the network and identify any anomalies.</p>

<p>permissionless transmission of trusted data already available to the network.</p>

<p>specifically address queries.</p>

<p>The internet of money requires permissionless transmission of data, at scale.</p>

<p>How do we expand the throughput of computation Ethereum can support? Current initiatives include Plasma, Raiden Network, etc.</p>

<p>Scalability is not just how fast txns can be minted, it’s also the health and visibility of the network as a whole. 
“How do I know the node I’m connected to (because I’m using a hosted service like Metamask) is a node that is trustworthy or that this data is correct?”</p>
